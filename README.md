This is a simple tool for tracking knitting projects!

When you knit, you would typically follow a 'pattern' which explains what types of knits you need to do, how many rows to do them for, and how many times to repeat the process.

This typically requires pen and paper or just memory, but with multiple projects side-by-side it becomes hard to track it all.

This is one of my first projects and is designed to be incredibly simple (but still aesthetically-pleasing enough to be usable). Project data is stored locally.

If you know someone who knits, send them this!! I made this for my girlfriend so it should hopefully be quite usable for just about anyone. 

I plan to add some minor customisability to the tool at some point (e.g., custom keys).
